# Crypto Wallet Tracker

## 📌 Project Description
The **Crypto Wallet Tracker** is a smart contract that allows users to register their wallet and maintain a simple on-chain “note balance.” This balance is not real cryptocurrency but serves as a user-defined tracker or portfolio note. The contract stores wallet information and provides transparent access to data.

## 🌟 Project Vision
To create a foundational on-chain tracking system that helps users maintain wallet-related metadata securely without relying on centralized applications. This can evolve into a full analytics or portfolio management DApp.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Wallet Registration:** Users can register themselves in the tracker.
- **Balance Notes:** Stores a custom balance metric for each wallet.
- **On-chain Data Access:** Anyone can retrieve wallet info for transparency.
- **Event Logging:** All updates emit events for easy frontend integration.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integrate real blockchain balance lookups using oracles.
- Add support for tracking multiple tokens.
- Implement portfolio analytics and history logs.
- Create a Web3 front-end dashboard for user interaction.
- Enable role-based access and wallet tagging.
